# swiftpick.nvim

`swiftpick.nvim` is a [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) plugin that provides a simple
and efficient way to quickly switch between files in a project. It's heavily
inspired by [Harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon/tree/harpoon2),
with some workflow changes that I find to immensely improve the user experience.

## Features

- **Instant File Navigation**: Quickly switch between files in your project with
  just one or two keystrokes.
- **Easy Editing**: Modify your switch list directly like a normal buffer.
- **Project-aware or global contexts**: Use separate file lists per project or
  one shared, global list.
- **Relative or absolute paths**: Toggle how file paths are displayed.
- **Flexible Hotkey Placement**: Insert or remove files at any hotkey. Entries
  automatically shift, and missing slots are filled as needed.
- **Prune entries**: Remove all empty or duplicate slots in one action,
  compacting the list.
- **Highly configurable**: Easily change key mappings, picker hints, and more.
- **Telescope picker with preview**: Browse the same list through
  [`telescope.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim), with the
  saved location previewed next to it.
- **Built-in lualine support**: See your currently available keybinds in the
  statusline.

## Quickstart

This section contains ready-made configurations you can copy and paste straight
into your Neovim setup.

### `lz.n`

Example configuration for [`lz.n`](https://github.com/lumen-oss/lz.n):

```lua
return {
  "swiftpick.nvim",
  keys = {
    { "<leader>h", "<CMD>SwiftPick", desc = "Open SwiftPick" },
    { "<leader>H", "<CMD>SwiftPickGlobal", desc = "Open SwiftPick [Global]" },
  },
  after = function()
    require("swiftpick").setup({
      -- your options here
    })
  end,
}
```

### `lazy.nvim`

Example configuration for [`lazy.nvim`](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
return {
  "codevogel/swiftpick.nvim",
  opts = {
      -- your options here
  },
  keys = {
    { "<leader>h", "<CMD>SwiftPick", desc = "Open SwiftPick" },
    { "<leader>H", "<CMD>SwiftPickGlobal", desc = "Open SwiftPick" },
  },
}
```

### Manual Setup

A minimal manual setup for `swiftpick` is as follows:

```lua
require("swiftpick").setup({})
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>h", function()
  require("swiftpick.actions").open_picker()
end, { desc = "Open SwiftPick" })

-- Optional: Configure an alternative hotkey to open the picker with
-- the global context as default.
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>H", function()
  require("swiftpick.actions").open_picker({ use_global_context = true })
end, { desc = "Open SwiftPick" })
```

## Configuration

`swiftpick` is designed to work out of the box with zero configuration, but you
can change it's behavior to fit your workflow. See the tables below (or your
`lua-ls` type hints!) for a detailed description of what each configuration
option does.

The options that are of main interest are:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

- `display_absolute_path_by_default`: Whether to show absolute paths in the
  picker by default.
- `use_global_context_by_default` and `use_global_context_by_default`: Whether
  to use the global storage context by default (This sets the context used when
  `swiftpick` is opened for the first time using `:SwiftPick` or
  `require("swiftpick.actions").open_picker()`. Individual calls can be
  overridden with
  `require("swiftpick.actions").open_picker({ use_global_context = true|false, display_absolute_paths = true|false })`.
  Note that these overrides do not store the current toggle state in your
  session.
- `keybinds`: Keybinds that are available when the picker window is open. Feel
  free to re-use other keybinds from your config, as they will be overridden in
  the picker context.
  - `keybinds.pick_entry.chars` is a `<string, string|nil>` table that takes in
    a `_<index>` on the lefthand side and a `char` on the righthand side which
    you want to assign that index to. By default, this makes `<leader>ha` pick
    the first file, `<leader>hj` the second file, etc. **Note:** Changing these
    values will automatically update the key hint shown in the picker window as
    well!
  - `keybinds.pick_entry.digits` is a similar table, allowing you re-assign the
    digit mappings. 1-indexed by default, so `<leader>h1` picks the first file,
    `<leader>h2` picks the second file, etc., but if you really want to 0-index
    them for some strange reason, you can!
- `show_hints`: A table that enables / disables keybind-hints for any of the
  actions available in the picker window. If you already know the keybinds, you
  can disable them to clean up how the picker window looks. If `all` is `true`,
  all hints are shown. If `all` is `false`, no hints are shown. Set `all` to
  `nil` (default) if you want to only show/hide specific hint keys.

### Advanced Configuration Example

Say you want to set up some additional keybinds bypassing the `swiftpick` window
completely. You could use the
[`swiftpick.actions`](https://github.com/codevogel/swiftpick.nvim/blob/main/lua/swiftpick/actions.lua)
module directly.

For example, if you want to add the current file to the first GLOBAL slot, you
could of course just open the picker in global mode and press `a`, or you could
set up a keybind to do it for you:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>AG", function()
  require("swiftpick.actions").add_entry(
    { use_global_context = true, filename = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(0) }
  )
end, { desc = "[A]dd [G]lobal to swiftpick" })
```

By default, adding an entry opens a prompt asking you for a label. You can skip
that prompt for a single call with `prompt_for_label = false`, in which case the
label defaults to the text of the line the entry points at:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>ag", function()
  require("swiftpick.actions").add(
    { use_global_context = true, prompt_for_label = false }
  )
end, { desc = "[a]dd [g]lobal to swiftpick without a label prompt" })
```

You can also pass `label = "my label"` to set the label directly, or set
`prompt_for_label_on_add = false` in `setup()` to disable the prompt everywhere
(including the picker's `a`/`A` keybinds and the `:SwiftPickAdd*` commands).

### Telescope Integration

`swiftpick` ships a [`telescope.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
extension that lists the exact same entries as the picker window, but with the
saved location shown in the preview panel. This is handy when your list has
grown past the handful of entries you know by heart, or when several entries
point at the same file and you want to see what is actually there before
jumping.

Load it after telescope is set up:

```lua
require("telescope").load_extension("swiftpick")
```

Then use any of:

```vim
:Telescope swiftpick          " uses the current context
:Telescope swiftpick local    " force the project-local list
:Telescope swiftpick global   " force the global list
```

The same is available as user commands (`:SwiftPickTelescope`,
`:SwiftPickTelescopeLocal`, `:SwiftPickTelescopeGlobal`) and from lua:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>hf", function()
  require("swiftpick.actions").open_telescope_picker()
end, { desc = "Find swiftpick entry" })

vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>hF", function()
  require("swiftpick.actions").open_telescope_picker({ use_global_context = true })
end, { desc = "Find swiftpick entry [Global]" })
```

Each result is rendered as `<index> <emoji> <path>:<line>  <label>`, where the
index is the entry's position in the list (so it matches the hotkey you would
press in the picker window), and the emoji prefix follows the same rules as the
picker window. Empty slots are skipped, since there is nothing to preview.
Selecting an entry opens the file and jumps to the stored line.

Inside the picker:

| Mapping        | Action                                                |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `<CR>`         | Open the entry at its stored line.                    |
| `<C-d>` / `d`  | Remove the highlighted entry from the list.           |
| `<C-g>`        | Toggle between the project-local and the global list. |
| `<C-t>`        | Toggle between relative and absolute paths.           |

Toggling inside the telescope picker only affects that picker; it does not
change the context used by the picker window.

These mappings can be changed through the `telescope.mappings` option in
`setup()`, or through the extension config, which takes precedence:

```lua
require("telescope").setup({
  extensions = {
    swiftpick = {
      mappings = {
        delete_entry = { i = "<C-x>", n = "dd" },
        -- set a mode to `false` to disable it
        toggle_display_absolute_paths = { i = false, n = "<C-t>" },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

Any other telescope option (a theme, `layout_config`, ...) can be passed along
too, either through the extension config or per call:

```lua
require("swiftpick.actions").open_telescope_picker(
  require("telescope.themes").get_ivy({ use_global_context = true })
)
```

### Lualine Integration

`swiftpick` has built-in support for
[lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim).

You can enable it by adding a component
`{ require("swiftpick.lualine").component() }` to one of your lualine sections.
For example,

```lua
return {
  {
    "lualine.nvim",
    after = function()
      -- we have to ensure swiftpick is loaded before we can use it in lualine
      require("lz.n").trigger_load("swiftpick")       require("lualine").setup({
        options = {
          -- your opts here
        },
        sections = {
          -- here we add the swiftpick component to the `lualine_c` section,
          -- after the `filename` component:
          lualine_c = {
            "filename",
            { require("swiftpick.lualine").component() },
          },
        },
      })
    end,
  },
}
```

The lualine component is highly configurable to make it look just like you want
it to look. You can pass any of the below options to
`require("swiftpick.lualine").component(opts)` to customize the appearance of
the component.

The default appearance is shown in the demo gif above.

```lua
---@class SwiftpickLualineComponentOpts
---@field prefix string|nil Icon to display as indicator for the swiftpick component.
---@field local_indicator string|nil Indicator to display before the local shortcuts. (This is never shown when `only_show_active_context` is true.)
---@field local_indicator_active string|nil Indicator to display before the local shortcuts when the context is active.
---@field local_prefix string|nil Prefix to display before the local shortcuts.
---@field local_suffix string|nil Suffix to display after the local shortcuts.
---@field local_global_separator string|nil Separator to display between the local and global segments. Not used if `only_show_active_context` is true.
---@field global_indicator string|nil Indicator to display before the global shortcuts. (This is never shown when `only_show_active_context` is true.)
---@field global_indicator_active string|nil Indicator to display before the global shortcuts when the context is active.
---@field global_prefix string|nil Prefix to display before the global shortcuts.
---@field global_suffix string|nil Suffix to display after the global shortcuts.
---@field active_prefix string|nil Prefix to display before a shortcut when the file is active.
---@field active_suffix string|nil Suffix to display after a shortcut when the file is active.
---@field empty_entry string|nil String to display for an empty entry in the shortcuts list.
---@field concat_separator string|nil Separator to use when concatenating the shortcuts list.
---@field use_digits boolean|nil Whether to use digits instead of characters for the shortcuts list.
---@field only_show_active_context boolean|nil Whether to only show the keybinds for the active context.
```

With these defaults (some of the below icons may not render properly in your
browser as they use glyphs from a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)):

```lua
---@type SwiftpickLualineComponentOpts
local defaults = {
  prefix = "󱗆  ",
  local_indicator = "󰟙",
  local_indicator_active = "!",
  local_prefix = " ",
  local_suffix = "",
  local_global_separator = "   ",
  global_indicator = "",
  global_indicator_active = "!",
  global_prefix = " ",
  global_suffix = "",
  active_prefix = "[",
  active_suffix = "]",
  empty_entry = "",
  concat_separator = " ",
  use_digits = false,
  only_show_active_context = false,
}
```

## Differences with `harpoon`

Think of `swiftpick` as `harpoon` with visibility built in, and some added
niceties.

With `harpoon`, you usually jump straight to a file via hotkeys without opening
any UI. This has the advantage of speed, but the disadvantage of not knowing
what file is actually bound to which hotkey. If you forget, you have to open the
UI to check.

`swiftpick` flips that slightly: by default, it always opens a picker to show
your full file list and bindings, but, if you already know what's where, you can
also just ignore these and jump instantly like you would in `harpoon`. So you
get both speed _and_ context when you need it.

Additionally, `swiftpick` has a few features that `harpoon` lacks:

- Visible hotkey mappings: The picker shows exactly which keys map to which
  files.
- Global + local contexts: Separate project-specific and cross-project file
  lists.

> But why? I want to jump to files without opening a picker!

Well, you can do that with `swiftpick` too! It kind of defeats the purpose of
this plugin, as all you're saving is a single keystroke, but if you really want
to, you can just set up your keybinds using the `swiftpick.actions` module
directly, and skip the picker entirely.

Fair enough. Feel free to use what you like!
